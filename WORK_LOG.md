| 11/29 | 9:35 - 9:50pm  | I opened the files and thought back to class before break to brainstorm ideas for how to organize the code. |
| 11/30 | 9:20 - 10:00pm |             I thought through the code and then wrote out basic psuedocode for how to approach the problem. |
| 12/2  | 7:50 - 8:20pm  |                                    I wrote out some code along the idea of making a map to store each word. |
