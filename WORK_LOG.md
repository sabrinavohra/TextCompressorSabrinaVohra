| 11/29 |  9:35 - 9:50pm  |                                                                                                 I opened the files and thought back to class before break to brainstorm ideas for how to organize the code. |
| 11/30 | 9:20 - 10:00pm  |                                                                                                             I thought through the code and then wrote out basic psuedocode for how to approach the problem. |

| 12/2  | 10:25 - 11:00pm | I ran into a problem with my idea with the static variables and the ArrayList. For some reason, the values won't carry over from the compress() to expand() method, so the map cannot be properly accessed. |
