| 11/29 |  9:35 - 9:50pm  |                                                                                                 I opened the files and thought back to class before break to brainstorm ideas for how to organize the code. |
| 11/30 | 9:20 - 10:00pm  |                                                                                                             I thought through the code and then wrote out basic pseudocode for how to approach the problem. |
| 12/2  |  7:50 - 8:20pm  |                                                                                                                                     I wrote out some code with the idea of making a map to store each word. |
| 12/2  | 10:25 - 11:00pm | I ran into a problem with my idea with the static variables and the ArrayList. For some reason, the values won't carry over from the compress() to expand() method, so the map cannot be properly accessed. |
| 12/3  | 11:15 - 11:55am |                                                                            I worked through differentiating between common words and uncommon by turning some into binary by letter and some by whole word. |
| 12/3  |  5:10 - 5:35pm  |                                                                                                                                    I completed a basic version of the code that I started writing in class. |
| 12/10 | 12:45 - 1:20pm  |                                                                                    I worked through the LZW version of compress() with Mr. Blick's help. I'm trying to figure out how to find the prefixes. |
| 12/10 |  1:20 - 1:45pm  |                                                   I continued working through the LZW algorithm and worked through the while method. I think I have more clarity, and my next step is to approach expand(). |
| 12/12 | 10:05 - 10:40am |         I added all the values up to 256 in compress() and started working on expand(). I am currently stuck on how to figure out the letter/String value for a code if it is greater than 256 in expand(). |
| 12/12 | 11:30 - 11:55am |                                                                                                          I worked through the expand() method after learning to add codes as I go through the read in file. |
| 12/13 |  9:20 - 9:30am  |              I worked on debugging an out of bounds error that I think is caused by the way I'm incrementing through the text in compress(). I think I need to rethink the way I'm moving through the file. |
| 12/15 | 10:25 - 10:40pm |        I looked through my code and made sure the process I followed made sense. I tried to rethink the compress() code to not use substring because I figured that was the root of my out of bounds error. |
